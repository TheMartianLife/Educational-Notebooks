# Educational-Notebooks
Sometimes I make silly notebooks to teach people things. I find them later in my [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) drive and think "I should really put these somewhere; someone might get a kick out of it." So, finally, I did.

These are often only lightly commented, occasionally out of date, sometimes incomplete, and not licensed for any useful applications beyond having fun. Enjoy.
